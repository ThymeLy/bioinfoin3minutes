Current potential vaccines : IL-6, IL-1 blocker as current best candidates  
Alternatively, anti-GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor), anti-TNF

Current focus is on targeting cytokines, or preferably many cytokines at once.  

If the goal is to tackle many cytokines at once, then why not just use steroids?  
- steroid dexamethasone only effective on seriously ill patients (i.e. patients on ventilator)

Tracking patient's inflammatory response before becoming life-threatening can be done with clinical test of **ferritin** and **C-reactive protein**,  
but it does not tell much about the pathogenesis direction.
